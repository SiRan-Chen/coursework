#The code implementation sequence is: data_processed.R——Exploratory_spatio-temporal_data_analysis.R——MSARIMA.R——DSHW.R——STARIMA.R(optional)

##Due to the large amount of data in the original dataset, running the STARIMA code script will be particularly slow, taking about 5 hours. But I additionally provided a compressed file of the entire project on Moodle, which stores some process files, making the process slightly easier. However, in summary, the fitting effect of the STARIMA model is not good, and it is not the main method used in this study, so this step is optional.

##Standardize file paths in code scripts as relative paths rather than absolute paths.If you have already downloaded the original dataset, you can place it in the corresponding directory of the project to use.

## I also submitted a compressed file on Moodle, but it doesn't contain any process files because those files are too large
